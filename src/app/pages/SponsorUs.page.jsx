						We are excited to invite you to be a sponsor for our Tunisian
						students who will be participating in the upcoming IEEE TSYP event.

						engineering. By sponsoring our students, you can help them achieve
						their goals and make a real difference in their lives.
						<p className="mt-4">
							As a sponsor, you will have the chance to be recognized as a
							supporter of education and innovation, while also promoting your
							brand to a wider audience. Your support will help cover the costs
							of travel, accommodation, and registration fees for our students,
							allowing them to fully participate in the event and take advantage
							of all the opportunities it offers.
